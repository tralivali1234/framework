# LogicCodeGenerator

Reads all the `System.Type` in the main entities assembly that inherit from `Entity` and are non-abstract, and, after grouping by module name, generates logic files that include: 

* The `sb.Include<T>()` instructions to include each entity types in the database schema. 
* The `dqm.RegisterQuery(key, query)` instructions to register the default query for each type. 
* The `new Graph<T>.Execute(key) {}.Register()` instructions to register the operations declared for the type.

Additionally, the module is also able to declare expression queries to simplify navigating relationships backwards in the business logic, or also register them in the `DynamicQueryManager` to let end users do the same in the `SearchControl`.
